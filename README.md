# Elevate-Labs-Task-3

Approach - 
1. Looked at the data for categorical variables.
2. Replaced the categorical data with numerical labels to suit our Linear Regression Task.
3. Separated the 'price' column from the data as Y and the remaining as X.
4. Split the data with 20% test size.
5. Trained the model and reviewed the coefficients and intercept.
6. Tested the model on test data and evaluated using MAE, MSE and R2_SCORE metrics.
